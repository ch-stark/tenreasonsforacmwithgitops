# 10 Reasons to Choose Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) for GitOps with ArgoCD

## 1. UI-Support: ApplicationSets, Single Pane of Glass

RHACM offers a user-friendly interface with support for ApplicationSets, allowing you to define and manage multiple applications across clusters. The Single Pane of Glass view provides a consolidated overview of your entire multi-cluster environment, simplifying the monitoring and management of applications.

## 2. Integration with MultiCluster Search

Efficiently locate and manage resources across multiple clusters with RHACM's integrated MultiCluster Search. This feature empowers administrators to quickly identify and act upon resources, enhancing the overall observability and control of the Kubernetes landscape.

## 3. Pull-Model Option

RHACM supports a pull-model option, allowing you to synchronize configurations from Git repositories using ArgoCD. This flexibility enables you to choose the workflow that best fits your organizational needs, whether it's a pull or push model. Enjoy the benefits of the Pull-Model option, such as enhanced performance, managing GitOps installations with policies, and comprehensive AppSet summary reports.

## 4. Integration with Cluster Lifecycle

Streamline the cluster lifecycle management with RHACM's integrated tools. Whether you are provisioning new clusters or decommissioning old ones, RHACM ensures a seamless integration with the cluster lifecycle, reducing manual efforts and minimizing errors.

## 5. Strong Built-in RBAC Support with Centralized Push Model

RHACM provides robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) support, particularly beneficial when utilizing a Centralized Push Model. Enjoy two significant advantages when using the push model in ACM. By default, users can create the ACM GitOpsCluster API for generating cluster admin secrets for all managed clusters. Additionally, users can generate cluster secrets with customized roles for all managed clusters by leveraging the ACM ClusterPermission/ManagedServiceAccount API.

## 6. Integration with Placement for Advanced MultiCluster Scheduling

Take advantage of advanced scheduling capabilities with RHACM's integration with Placement. Efficiently distribute workloads across clusters based on defined policies, optimizing resource utilization and improving overall cluster performance.

## 7. MultiCluster Optimized Dashboards

Visualize and analyze the health and performance of your multi-cluster environment through RHACM's optimized dashboards. Gain insights into the status of applications, clusters, and resources, facilitating informed decision-making.

## 8. Supported Gatekeeper Integration

RHACM seamlessly integrates with Gatekeeper, allowing you to enforce policies and ensure compliance across clusters. This integration enhances the security and reliability of your Kubernetes deployments.

## 9. Integration with Governance for Advanced Use Cases

Leverage RHACM's integration with Governance to implement advanced use cases, such as managing custom objects and raw templates. This flexibility empowers you to tailor your Kubernetes configurations to meet specific requirements.

## 10. Advanced Disaster Recovery Capabilities with ODF Integration

Integrate RHACM with Open Data Foundation (ODF) for advanced Disaster Recovery (DR) capabilities. Ensure the resilience of your applications and data across clusters, minimizing downtime and providing a reliable solution for business continuity.
